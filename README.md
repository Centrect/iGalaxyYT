#### Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profile 👋
I'm William, and I'm 15 years old. I'm a self-taught full-stack web developer.

I don't really have anything to show off at the moment, but I can assure you I have stuff in the works.

Recently I picked up [**TypeScript**](https://ts.org), and I'm completely obsessed with it. \
You might see a few projects coming soon that use it.

#### Need to contact me?
